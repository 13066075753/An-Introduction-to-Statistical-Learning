 An-Introduction-to-Statistical-Learning is one of the most popular books among data scientists to learn the conepts and intuitions behind 
 machine learning algorithms, however, the exercises are implemented in R language, which is a hinderence for all those who are using python
 language. To overcome this i have tried solving all the questions in practical exerices in Python language, so people using python language 
 can also get the most our of this amazing book. Along with that i have also provided the solutions for conceptual questions.
